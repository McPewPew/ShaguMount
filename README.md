# ShaguMount
A Vanilla Addon that automatically unmounts the player when using an action. It is quite similar to ezDismount, as it unmounts the Player whenever a action is used which cannot be done mounted or shapeshifted, however tt's written minimal and designed to work on every localized gameclient.
